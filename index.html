        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
         <p>I am now an Associate Professor and Ph.D./Master Supervisor at the School of Computer Science, at Central South University. Before that, I received my Ph.D. and bachelor's degrees from the Department of Electronic Information Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively, with Prof. Yide Ma.  I achieved a postdoc position at the School of Information Science and Engineering, with Prof. Min Wu, in 2015. Currently, I work at Central South University as an associate professor, as well as work in Digital Imaging Group of London, Dept. of Medical Biophysics, University of Western Ontario, Canada as a postdoc.

        <h2>Research Interests </h2>
        <p> Medical Image Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Computer Vision. </p>
        <p> I focus on interdisciplinary research in medical image analysis, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, for improving lesion detection, anatomical structure segmentation and quantification, computer-aided diagnosis, and 3D reconstruction, especially ophthalmic disease-related works. <br><br>
	    Recently, I have devoted myself to investigating the evidence-based diagnosis and interpretative deep learning model for medical image analysis, with the advantages of tools such as OOD, TTA, causal reasoning, and so on. In addition, I also focus on weakly-supervised learning architecture in medical images. <br>
